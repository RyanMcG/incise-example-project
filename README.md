# Incise example project

This is an example of an project setup for an incise website. One if the goals
of incise is to support many different configurations. That means that your
project does not have to look like this one. However, this is a good example.

Here are some others:

* [incise itself][proj] is an incise project that deploys the [incise
  website][website].
* [My blog][blog] is another example which includes a custom layout.

## OK, let's see it!

This project was deployed using incise's built-in git-branch deployment
workflow. This *deployed* site can be found [here][example-website].

## Usage

To start the development server:

    lein run

To see other options:

    lein run --help

For some better documentation checkout the [incise project][proj].
